### `npm run build`

Builds and bundles the minified app for production to the `./build` folder.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

At GIS • OPS we’re passionately developing geospatial software for our clients. We exclusively work with open-source libraries/software and publish & maintain many projects ourselves.

Our core areas of expertise:

routing applications/libraries in the widest sense (we're co-maintainers of Valhalla)
juggling OSM data and its wealth of analysis tools
QGIS plugin development
PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgRouting
web development, obviously often with maps
Our preferred projects integrate all these areas in a single use case.

We're dedicated to the open-source projects we publish and maintain, and encourage our employees and interns to dedicate some of their work time to collaborate on open-source libraries and apps.

We're always looking for enthusiastic people to join our team, either as an employee or intern. Feel free to send us an unsolicited application to enquiry@gis-ops.com.
